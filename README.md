# Github Profile Finder

> This Projects is used to display details from querying the github API and structuring a single page application to arrange the data gotten as response from the API call, it is broken down into three files the HTML file, the app.js file which contains the main app that makes instances of classes and calls the methods of the classes, the ui.js file which contains the UI class and all the methods that directly influence the user interface by either removing or adding from it, and the github.js file which similarly contains the methods that call from the github API, and also the client id and secret key to allow the github server to serve as many times as needed
